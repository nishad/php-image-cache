# php-image-cache
Caching remote images locally with mod rewrite and PHP

Original codes are from http://david.elbe.me/code/php/2014/09/17/cache-images-with-php.html

If the image is not available in the local cache, it will download from the remote server. This eliminates the re-downloading of the image from the remote server.
